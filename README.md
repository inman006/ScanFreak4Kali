### **ScanFreak! is a Python based, automated Network Scanner and Reconnaissance Tool specifically designed to integrate the Kali Linux toolbox**
#### Created by Ryan Inman

ScanFreak! is an easy to use, network scanning and reconnaissance tool which can takes in a host IP address and automates the following:

- Identifies all machines on the associated Network
- Runs complex nmap scans on each machine to determine services, versions, and associated operating systems of each machine and saves scan results to organized files
- If a web server is identified, ScanFreak! will automate an ennumeration of said web server as save output to file

NOTE: As this is a working project, please check back regularly for updates and new features!
